# Amped Adventures

Amped Adventures is a **2D puzzle-platformer** developed using **Godot 4**, centered around **electronics-inspired gameplay mechanics**. Players progress by solving logic-based puzzles that involve supplying the correct electrical components to power mechanisms and unlock new paths.

## Core Gameplay
- Power-based puzzles using **resistors and value matching**
- Mechanisms activate only when supplied with the **correct component**
- Visual feedback through sockets displaying required values
- Progressive difficulty through puzzle-driven level design

## Technical Highlights
- Built with **Godot 4**
- Event handling using **signals** for clean and decoupled interactions
- Modular architecture with centralized managers (Singleton pattern)
- Clear separation of gameplay logic, UI, and systems

## Design Goals
- Encourage logical thinking and problem-solving
- Maintain modular, scalable game architecture
- Keep gameplay intuitive while introducing technical depth

## Project Status
This project is under active development and serves as a learning-focused game project emphasizing clean architecture and system design.
